# PythonPerformanceAnalysis
A set of python scripts and programs that can be used to analyze performance data from TAU experiments.

## Detailed Description
This repository contains a set of python fucntions that can be used to organize, analyze, and plot results from measuring performance data using TAU.

Data for analysis should be stored in TAU profiles or our pickled format.

The scripts rely heavily on the functionality provided by pandas dataframes (https://pandas.pydata.org/) to store and manage the data. Pandas also provides considerable statistical analysis functionality and some plotting functions to further the analysis. Additionally, we use pyplot to create figures not available in pandas.

We recommned using the functions in conjuntion with jupyter notebooks (which is how our examples are written) as it provides easy visualization, documentation, and sharing of the work.
