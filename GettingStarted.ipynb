    "# Simple Performance Analysis with TAU Commander and Hatchet\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook guides you through a simple performance analysis use case that measures time with [http://taucommander.paratools.com/](TAU Commander) and then manipulates the data using [https://github.com/LLNL/hatchet](Hatchet).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up your environment\n",
    "\n",
    "First, follow the Getting Started instructions in the [README](README.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "## TAU Commander: Getting Started\n",
    "The first thing we will learn is how to use TAU Commander to collect and organize performance analysis data. This guide is intended as a simple overview of the TAU Commander tool from Paratools http://taucommander.paratools.com/ for people unfamiliar with [TAU](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/tau/home.php) or performance analysis in general. The authors of the TAU Commander provide much more comprehensive user guides.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will work with the P2Z benchmark, which you can obtain with:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/cerati/p2z-tests.git\n",
    "cd p2z-tests\n",
    "```\n",

    "## TAU Commander's Hierarchy of Performance Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "TAU Commander organizes performance measurement into a set of categories intended to simplify the process of setting up performance data gathering and encourage reuse of settings between experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* project - top level organization\n",
    "* target - hardware environment plus measurement libraries like Papi\n",
    "* application - program to test; defines what libraries and measurement techniques\n",
    "* measurements\n",
    "* experiments\n",
    "* trials\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurements can be configured to capture different metrics (time, hardware counters) at different granularities (functions, loops, custom regions). Typically, separate measurements are produced for each thread in a multi-threaded application and each MPI task for codes based on MPI. TAU also supports GPU measurement."

    "## Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The *project* is the big umbrella that keeps everything together. It exists as a .tau directory in the directory (folder) where you create your performance experiments. Typically, TAU Commander will automatically install TAU in this `.tau` subdirectory, as well as organize the measured data in folders that store standard TAU profile files, and XML/JSON files that help TAU remeber where it put everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "To initialize a project simply type the comand below in the directory where you wish to run your performance experiments. In your `p2z-tests` directory, create an experiments subdirectory where all subsequent steps will be taking place."

    "The *target* defines system information including OS, architecture, compilers, and external libraries, e.g., PAPI (which is needed for hardware counter data collection). Most of this information TAU can figure out on its own, but it often needs help finding a papi installation. Also, if you want to use source instrumentation add the '--pdt' flag to let TAU know.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, our goal is to do simple timing, so we will create a target without any external tools. The target name can be anything, but it helps to associate it with the machine name or type. For example, on a machine called arya and using gcc compilers, we could create the target as follows:\n",
